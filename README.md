```
It requires `torch`,`obspy`, `pyproj`, `pandas`, `POT` and `skfmm` (only from unknown wave speed model).


## Quick start in SeisBench and colab demo

HARPA seamlessly integrates with workflow in [SeisBench](https://github.com/seisbench/seisbench).

## Usage

To perform the association, use the following code:

```python
from harpa import association
pick_df_out, catalog_df = association(pick_df, station_df, config)
```

### Input Requirements

#### `pick_df`
A DataFrame containing seismic pick information with the following structure:

| id        | timestamp               | prob     | type |
|-----------|-------------------------|----------|------|
| CX.MNMCX. | 2014-04-01 00:08:45.410 | 0.113388 | p    |
| CX.MNMCX. | 2014-04-01 00:10:56.840 | 0.908900 | p    |
| CX.MNMCX. | 2014-04-01 00:13:01.930 | 0.795285 | p    |
| CX.MNMCX. | 2014-04-01 00:13:36.950 | 0.130214 | s    |

- `id`: Station id
- `timestamp`: arrival time of the picks (`np.datetime64`)
- `prob`: Optional column indicating the probability of the pick.
- `type`: Indicates the phase type (e.g., `p` or `s`).

#### `station_df`
A DataFrame containing seismic station information with the following structure:

| id       | x (km)     | y (km)     | z (km)   |
|----------|------------|------------|----------|
| CX.PB01. | 449.359240 | 7672.990624| -0.900   |
| CX.PB02. | 407.073618 | 7642.202105| -1.015   |
| CX.PB03. | 422.289208 | 7561.616351| -1.460   |

### Notes

1. **Multiprocessing and Seisbench Compatibility**:
   - The multiprocessing module might conflict with Seisbench's multithreading. If you use Seisbench first, wrap your association call as follows:

    ```python
    from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor
    with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=100) as executor:
        future = executor.submit(association, pick_df, station_df, config, verbose)
    pick_df_out, catalog_df = future.result()
    ```

   Otherwise, you can directly use:

    ```python
    pick_df_out, catalog_df = association(pick_df, station_df, config)
    ```

2. **Training Epochs**:
   - Fixed wave speed models require fewer training epochs. Unknown wave speed models may need more epochs.
   - Usually, for a fast association, we set  `epoch_before_decay`=`epoch_after_decay`=1000. For a detailed association (for more events) we set `epoch_before_decay`=`epoch_after_decay`=10000.  For unknown wave speed models, we set `epoch_before_decay`=`epoch_after_decay`=10000. A better early stop strategy will be implemented in the next version. 
3. **Using Unknown Speed Models**:
   - For unknown speed models, include a `model_traveltime` parameter:

    ```python
    pick_df_out, catalog_df = association(pick_df, station_df, config, model_traveltime=model_traveltime)
    ```

   - Here, `model_traveltime` is a model with the source location as input and travel times to each station as output. See the [example](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1tv6hiV4K7HAynv6j0rIkTjMnCFt8uhTF?usp=sharing) for details.

3. **Verbose Settings**:
   - `verbose > 10`: print picks and stations.
   - `verbose > 8`: print training details for each epoch.
   - `verbose > 6`: print training settings, including CPUs.
   - `verbose > 4`: print configuration details.
   - `verbose > 2`: print other details.
   - `verbose = 0`: silent mode.
